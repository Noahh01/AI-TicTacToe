# AI-TicTacToe
This was my second project using the pygame library. I created a tic tac toe game that has two game modes. The first game mode is multiplayer (two users faceoff) and the second game mode is against a CPU player. The CPU player was designed using AI to either beat the user or tie. 

# Motivation 
My motivation behind this project was to create a game that implements an AI that could play against a user. I wanted the AI to pose a challenge to the user so I designed it not to lose.

# How to use?
To run this project download all the python files and store them in one folder. Then run the TicTacToe.py file.

Files:
  - AI.py
  - button.py
  - CheckWinner.py
  - createText.py
  - Grid.py
  - TicTacToe.py (main)
